            <p>The Construction Industry plays an important role in the national welfare, including the development of
                residential buildings, commercial and industrial buildings, and the restoration of the nation’s
                infrastructure and other public centres. Its growth lies in the performance of its products that provide
                the basis for the industrial foundation. To thrive in this industry, organizations strive for safety,
                quality, performance, and attention to the details for making the project profitable.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the recent lockdown and several regulations imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
                construction industry has been impacted to a great extent. Now it is no longer the final product alone
                that is subjected to criticism but the procedures, workers, materials, etc are equally under pressure
                for better performance in the construction industry. Analysts and research firms are predicting steady
                growth in the coming years, yet multiple challenges are hovering in the construction sector.
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/Image.png" class="imgblog">
            <h2>Challenges faced by the Construction Industry:</h2>
            <h4>1. Rise in material costs:</h4>
            <p>The pandemic has severely disrupted both national and international supply chains considerably and it
                will take some time before everything returns to pre-COVID levels. The cost of raw materials is
                continuously on the rise due to shortage of its supply and government imposed taxes. The main reason for
                the lack of supply is due to the disruptive supply chain. Besides, to stabilize the economy, many
                reforms are also being introduced by the Governments. Additional cess on taxes is being introduced which
                will also lead to a rise in raw materials costs. The result is high expenses leading to a high-value
                assessment of the real estate constructions.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Employee Safety:</h4>
            <p>Safety and security are now a growing concern worldwide. With COVID 19 still a threat, the most important
                challenge for construction companies is to keep their employees healthy and free of COVID infections on
                the sites. Adequate safety measures must be adopted within the construction premises. Deploying a large
                number of employees or construction workers may lead to unprecedented infection spreads; affect work
                deliverables, and cause delays. On the other hand, the smaller number of employees impacts the project
                deadlines severely.
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/Fire safety.png" class="imgblog">
            <h4 style="margin-top: 0px;">3. Vendor selection is harder:</h4>
            <p>Because of the need of efficient and timely delivery of materials for the construction projects, there is
                a strong dependence on the vendors for the supply of materials and their transportation to the needed
                place. With so many options out there, it is hard to find the right vendor for the organization. That’s
                why creating an extensive list of vendor selection criteria is important.
                One can’t go into the vendor selection process without a solid idea of what is needed from a product or
                service as you will find yourself wasting a great deal of time and energy trying to compare different
                vendors.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Ongoing Project management and Auditing is difficult:</h4>
            <p>With the various ups and downs involved in the construction site, the main focus has been on completing
                the project in terms of details, and on time. However, in this process, accounting takes a backseat.
                Various problems make construction accounting challenging and make the project suffer as a result of
                these problems.
                <br>
                Some of them are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of communication</li>
                <li> Overhead Charges</li>
                <li> Payment Release and Manual Tracking</li>
                <li> Lack of Trust</li>
                <li> Inadequate Risk Management</li>
                <li> Limited Skills</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>5. Need of multiple clearances:</h4>
            <p>Completion of any construction demands multiple permits from various designated authorities. Electricity,
                land, services, pollution control, and environment preservation, etc are the areas where clearances or
                permits are mandatory. Even if the builders complete the construction work on time, delays in obtaining
                these permits may lead to delay in handing over the projects to the clients.
            </p>
            <h4>6. Effect of natural disasters:</h4>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;align-items: center;">
                <div style="width: 50%;">
                    <p>Natural disasters and hazards are unpredictable. So site selection is an important factor in the
                        construction projects. Even if the sites are close to raw materials zone, the fact that they are
                        located in earthquake-prone or flood-prone areas, diminishes the chances of being shortlisted
                        for the construction work. In addition, buildings need to be designed, and built in such a way
                        that they can withstand natural disasters and accidents.
                    </p>

                <div style="width: 45%;"><img src="/assets/Disaster.png" alt="" srcset=""></div>
            </div>
            <div class="researchbox">
                <div style="padding: 54px 41px;">
                    <h3>From our Research results:</h3>
                    <ul style="color: #365DA8EB;">
                        <li style="color: #365DA8EB;">
                            It has been evident from research that the inflation rate is around 3-4.5% in the
                            residential
                            buildings sector every year and around 3-5% in the non-residential buildings sector.</li>

                        <li style="color: #365DA8EB;">Due to Covid it is been come to notice that 66% companies have
                            started to move towards one or
                            the other ways of digitalization in their operations.</li>

                        <li style="color: #365DA8EB;">The current trend for buildings is about not the old ways but the
                            smart-styled structures and
                            facilities in terms of smart living standards.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>How to tackle these challenges?</h2>
            <h4>1. Vendor Sorting System:</h4>
            <p>This is a system that will be purely based on certain parameters which will be used to determine the
                loyalty of the vendor and also the quality of the vendor overall. Parameters can be grouped into various
                categories and each category will have an average score of the parameters inside and then based on that
                we can decide which vendor to be preferred.
                Some of the categories could be:
            </p>
            <p class="p_bold">a) Monetary: </p>
            <p>It will include parameters based on the quotation submitted and credit given. It might include parameters
                like <span style="color:blue">haggling rate</span> (The amount of negotiation that can be done to get
                the best rate in comparison to the
                market standards), <span style="color:blue">payment</span> terms (The handling of the payment transfer
                and time given for each
                installment), <span style="color:blue">transparency</span> (The receipts of the payment received and
                procedure involved the payment
                including legal and compliance), etc.</p>
            <p class="p_bold">b) Quality: </p>
            <p>The parameters used to measure quality will be based on vendor transparency and delivery of the material.
                Some of the parameters under this category will be like <span style="color:blue">Material Report</span>
                (It is about proper
                documentation against the material being supplied and its latest quality testing report i.e. around 1
                year to 2 years old, which shows that the vendor keeps the information updated on its material quality),
                <span style="color:blue">Transportation Facility</span> (transportation to be provided or will be
                provided and how efficient is the
                transportation facility and is there any delays from the delivery time), etc.
            </p>
            <p class="p_bold">c) Accessibility: </p>
            <p>This category focuses on the discipline of the vendor and also helps to judge the professionalism of the
                vendor. It could be measured by parameters like <span style="color:blue">delivery commitment</span> (The
                delivery commitment given is
                fulfilled in what ratio that is let say 80% time it is there and only 20% time the order has been
                delayed), <span style="color:blue">support</span> (How easy is it to get in touch with the vendor
                directly or with the team to track any
                pending orders or discuss the quotations. Is there any digital platform or management system by which it
                is organized), etc. </p>
            <h4>2. Labor Management System:</h4>
            <p>This is a bigger problem in the industry and the bigger problem lies with the skilled laborers or groups
                of laborers on constant terms. Mostly the laborers can be easily found through the labor contractors but
                to keep these labor contractors in check is sometimes a harder journey.
            </p>
            <img src="/assets/Labor Management.png" class="imgblog">
            <p>For every project, it could be done to keep a check on the labor contractors by giving them a digital
                website link or sending them a handcrafted mail or message regarding open quotations. This is needed to
                ensure that the one we normally prefer does not overcharge us overtime and at the same time get to know
                the market value itself. It also ensured that the ones who are currently employed will not try to do
                something foolish up to a certain extent in fear of not getting the next contract.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Site Management System:</h4>
            <p>
                Labors can still be controlled or managed in a way but the engineers and other skilled laborers and also
                the site management itself is tedious at times. The proper reporting is not done at times and then it is
                quite difficult to control the situations which arise at a later stage as consequences due to the
                wrongdoings which have happened in the past. To make this more efficient an audit list can be crafted
                per project basis which will be done on a time-to-time basis. It can be further also digitalized to look
                into it from anywhere in the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                It needs a paper format though as the internet unavailability can be a reason for people to slack off
                their work and make excuses. This list could be done in a certain standard fixed for the projects and
                could be further also added in a dashboard view if it is in a digitalized format. It is also useful to
                check for any possible delays in the future and can be tallied like a history report every time to check
                for any constant errors being done to figure the root problems happening at the time of the
                construction.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Better compliance to Employee safety and wellness:</h4>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;align-items: center;margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <div style="width: 50%;">
                    <p>Safety in construction sites comes at a price but has no alternative. Most times, workers aren’t
                        informed or knowledgeable about the health and safety risks they are put to in construction
                        sites. They must be able to read and understand Material Safety Data Sheets and are prepared for
                        the same without risking their life or health.
                        By using the right set of technology solutions, construction companies can help in safeguarding
                        the construction site and protecting the health of their employees. Workplace safety compliance
                        can be improved using intelligent thermal scanning, fall protection systems, digital fencing for
                        ensuring social distance between the staff, and several other possibilities.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div style="width: 45%;"><img src="/assets/Fire Safety1.png" alt="" srcset=""></div>
            </div>
            <p>Various challenges have been impacting the progress of the construction industry. The need of the hour is
                to mitigate the challenges by introducing modern technologies and scaling up the labor force. By using
                the right set of technology solutions and forums, construction companies can efficiently increase their
                productivity. Along with it, it is also important for maintaining a professional reputation and most
                importantly staying profitable. </p>
